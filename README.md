# Heftier
Heftier, a composition of hefty trees and co-Yoneda, is a higher-order effects
version of Freer.

* Casper Bach Poulsen and Cas van der Rest. 2023. Hefty Algebras: Modular
    Elaboration of Higher-Order Algebraic Effects. Proc. ACM Program. Lang. 7,
    POPL, Article 62 (January 2023), 31 pages. <https://doi.org/10.1145/3571255>

inspires this library.
Hefty trees, proposed by the above paper, are extensions of free monads,
allowing for a straightforward treatment of higher-order effects.

This library provides Heftier monads and Freer monads, encoded into data
types in several ways to enable tuning in pursuit of high performance.
