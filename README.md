# Heftia
Heftia, a composition of hefty trees and co-Yoneda, is a higher-order effects
version of Freer.

inspires this library.
Hefty trees, proposed by the above paper, are extensions of free monads,
allowing for a straightforward treatment of higher-order effects.

This library provides Heftia monads and Freer monads, encoded into data
types in several ways to enable tuning in pursuit of high performance.
